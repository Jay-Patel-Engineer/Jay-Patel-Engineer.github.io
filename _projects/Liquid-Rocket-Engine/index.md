## Initial Project Conditions
Beyond the development of a liquid rocket engine, three constraints were also included in the initial request of the project. These constraints include a target performance metric, propellant sourcing, and a budget. The requested performance metric is defined by a target thrust of 300 Newtons. The propellant sourcing constraint outlines the use of propellants that can be stored and used without the need for cryogenics. Finally the initial proposed budget is $1,000.
## CEA Analysis
Of the propellants readily available without the need for cryogenic storage, kerosene and nitrous oxide best fit this description. To determine the several other parameters needed to begin the design of the thrust chamber, NASA's CEARUN software was utilized. This software allows for quick calculations of several constants related to the gas produced after combustion, such as its temperature, specific heat, and specific impulse. By varrying the initial chamber pressure, the graph below showing the relationship between specific impulse, oxidizer to fuel ratio, and chamber temperature can be created. While the ideal design would use an oxidizer to fuel ratio of about 7, the temperature generated by the combustion would be too high. Thus, a ratio of 2.3 was selected.

## Thrust Chamber
The thrust chamber is an assembly of the combustion chamber, nozzle, and injection plate. The thrust chamber houses all the components required to ensure efficient propellant injection, propellant combustion, and combustion exhaust. Each component's design process and analysis is described in detail in the following sections.

### Combustion Chamber
The combustion chamber houses the main brunt of the combustion. For that reason, it must be built to withstand any and all theromdyamic and stress forces.
