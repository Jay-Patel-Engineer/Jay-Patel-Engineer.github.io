## Initial Project Conditions
Beyond the development of a liquid rocket engine, three constraints were also included in the initial request of the project. These constraints include a target performance metric, propellant sourcing, and a budget. The requested performance metric is defined by a target thrust of 300 Newtons. The propellant sourcing constraint outlines the use of propellants that can be stored and used without the need for cryogenics. Finally the initial proposed budget is $1,000.
## CEA Analysis
Of the propellants readily available without the need for cryogenic storage, kerosene and nitrous oxide best fit this description. To determine the several other parameters needed to begin the design of the thrust chamber, NASA's CEARUN software was utilized. This software allows for quick calculations of several constants related to the gas produced after combustion, such as its temperature, specific heat, and specific impulse. By varrying the initial chamber pressure, the graph below showing the relationship between specific impulse, oxidizer to fuel ratio, and chamber temperature can be created. While the ideal design would use an oxidizer to fuel ratio of about 7, the temperature generated by the combustion would be too high. Thus, a ratio of 2.3 was selected.

## Thrust Chamber
The thrust chamber is an assembly of the combustion chamber, nozzle, and injection plate. The thrust chamber houses all the components required to ensure efficient propellant injection, propellant combustion, and combustion exhaust. Each component's design process and analysis is described in detail in the following sections.

### Combustion Chamber
The combustion chamber houses the main brunt of the combustion. For that reason, it must be built to withstand any and all theromdyamic and stress forces. From the prior CEA analysis, the required specifications for the combustion chamber can be found. In order to increase the ease of manufacturing, several factors were also considered. These factors include the relationship between the contraction ratio of the combustion chamber and expansion ratio of the nozzle as well as the critical length. By ensuring the contraction ratio is larger than the expansion ratio, the ease of manufacturing increases substantially with little to no performance impact on the final product.

### Injection Plate
The injection plate is undoubtly the most important component of the thrust chamber. It is responsible for delivering both propellants at their required flow rates as well as ensuring optimal mixing prior to combustion. Of the several designs and methods that exist for propellant injection, the final selection was between an impingment injector and a pintle injector. The main difference between these two is the delivery method of the propellants; the former uses angled paths to impinge both propellant streams and the latter uses a radial injection method. The pintle injector is far more efficient and easier to manufacture due to its radial nature, thus making it the final selection. To minimize risks of combustion backflow, deadspace within the pintle injector was reduced as much as possible while still maintaining manufacturability.
