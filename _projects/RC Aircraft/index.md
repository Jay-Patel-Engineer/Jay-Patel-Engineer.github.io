## Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to design an aircraft that is capable of flight. In the case of this project, successful performance metrics are defined as the aircraft's ability to maintain static stability, dynamic stability, and steady longitudinal flight.
## Initial Aircraft Modeling
By modeling the aircraft using XFLR5 and SolidWorks, a baseline set of parameters can be obtained that are essential for all of the calculations necessary. By using SolidWorks, it is possible to extract a simulated inertia tensor for the aircraft. These moments of inertia can then be input into XFLR5 to simulate the aircraft under an airspeed of 10 m/s.
